How to sync onpremAD to AzureAD with the help of AAD Connect...

Quite often when I am giving the tech briefing sessions on Azure IAM, I feel the need for an active LAB where my audience can simply go to follow some high level steps to better visualise the true power of Azure hybrid Identity and Management. I would like to keep this intro section short and crack on with the LAB build. The reason simply being there are tonnes of material available on MS DOCS such as:

AAD: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/active-directory/ and
AAD Connect: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect
